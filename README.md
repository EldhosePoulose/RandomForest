Random-Forest-Notes
This repository contains my experiments on random forest adn decision trees.

The dataset used in the RandomForest.m is the breast-cancer-wisconsin dataset from UCI repository. Visit the link (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/wdbc.data) for the datafile or use the edited data here(https://github.com/eldhose980/RandomForest/blob/master/wdbc.mat).

Check the .m file in the repository (https://github.com/eldhose980/RandomForest/blob/master/RandomForest.m) to see code, comments, explanations and images. 
Feel free to download the code and use it for your project and corrections and suggestions are highly welcoming.
